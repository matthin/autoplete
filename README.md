# Easy Complete
Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.matthin.com/easy_complete/current/index.html).

This project uses ES6 features, so it's only compatible with the very latest browsers. I may sometime in the feature try [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), but right now I'm not too concerned.

# Developers
`npm install git+https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc.git -g`
